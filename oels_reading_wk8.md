## The plan for week 8

This week we are looking at Loy & Smith (2020), which is an under-revision paper by my postdoc [Jia Loy](https://jialoy.github.io) and me. This paper reports a bunch of experiments (5 total in this version, although we have to add more in the revision) where participants interact with a partner on a picture-description task where they take turns describing pictures, e.g. of a burglar handing a cake to a soldier. Unbeknownst (usually) to the genuine participants, one of the two people in the interaction is a confederate (in the sense of "accomplice") of the experimenter, i.e. someone who is working with the experimenter and is producing descriptions according to a script. This confederate priming technique allows us to control the structure of the descriptions produced by one interlocutor and see how that affects the descriptions used by the other interlocutor, the genuine participant. The standard result in these paradigms is that participants are influenced to produce PO (prepositional object, e.g. "the burglar hands the cake to the soldier") or DO (double object, e.g. "the burglar hands the soldier the cake") descriptions based on whether the confederate used PO or DO descriptions; if the confederate produces a PO the participant is more likely to do so on their subsequent trial. We were interested in whether this effect would be modulated by the perceived linguistic knowledge of the confederate; in particular, if you are interacting with a non-native speaker, are you influenced by their productions *more* (you have uncertainty about how their grammar of English works, their actual behaviour in interaction is the best evidence you can get, and on the assumption that you want them to understand you it makes sense to use the same constructions they are using) or *less* (because you discount their linguistic behaviour somewhat, or try to model 'correct' behaviour for them) than you would be by a native speaker. We ended up running studies both in the lab and online, which in both cases show effects of confederate non-nativeness, but in opposite directions - our lab participants adapted to non-natives more, our online participants less.

As usual, in this week's practical you'll get a chance to look at a similar experiment in jsPsych, which will involve audio stimuli again but also the infrastructure to record audio from your participants via their browser.

## Reading tasks for this week

Read:
- [Joy, J. E., & Smith, K. (2020). Syntactic adaptation depends on perceived linguistic knowledge: Native English speakers differentially adapt to native and non-native confederates in dialogue. https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/pu2qa.](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/pu2qa)

This is a preprint of a paper that is currently under revision (i.e. we got an initial round of reviewer reports, we are making some revisions to the paper, then it'll go back to the reviewers for another look).

A couple of things to note:
- The paper is pretty long, sorry! One of the other things we need to do in revising it is trim it down, although since we are also adding 2 more experiments that's a challenge.
- One of the reasons we ran an online version was that the lab results are somewhat equivocal - there are effects of non-nativeness there, but the sample is relatively small and we were worried those effects wouldn't replicate. However, running these studies in the lab is quite time-consuming and difficult logistically (you have to manage your pool of confederates as well as the participants), so we went for online data collection, at which point we found that the result didn't replicate, and indeed flipped. It's slightly hard to know how to interpret this. Does this mean the lab result was a fluke and we should just trust the online data since it's a larger sample? Or that different participant populations (students vs MTurk workers) tested in different circumstances (face-to-face in the lab vs remotely online) will show different patterns of adaptation? If the latter, why? We haven't resolved this question at this point, I'll be interested to hear your thoughts!
