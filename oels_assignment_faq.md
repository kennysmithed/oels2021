## Assessment 1

### What do you mean "For articles which are particularly relevant to your (current) plan for Assessment 2, highlight its relevance and how it has shaped your thinking."

This is just to help me see how the papers you are reading fit towards some (potentially vague at this stage!) plan for Assessment 2. For instance, if you review a paper on sequence learning in kittens I am going to be wondering how that fits into your plan for Assessment 2, but if you say in your bibliography "I was interested in sequence learning, and I think the method used in this paper will be ideal for an online sequence learning task with human participants, for the following reasons: ..." then I can see how it fits, plus you get credit for spotting an interesting and relevant paper and for explicitly explaining your clever ideas about its potential relevance to me.
